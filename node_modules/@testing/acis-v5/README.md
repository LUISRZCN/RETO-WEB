## Acis v5

`Acis v5` is a light weight set of services built on top of **WebDriverIO v5** with the aim of providing a series of patterns and tools to help us implement e2e testing in an easy way.  

-----------------------

### 1. Installation

Just assure that `acis-v5` is part of your dependencies in your project's **package.json** (choose carefully if it should be installed as dependency or devDependency):

```json
{
    "devDependencies": {
        "@testing/acis-v5": "^2.1.6"
    }
}
```

You can simply do it by executing:

```bash
    npm install @testing/acis-v5 --save-dev
```    

-----------------------

### 2. Packages

The following suite includes two types of packages: **Global Testing** and **WebdriverIO** packages. If you don't need some of the dependencies integrated here, feel free to install them separately.
