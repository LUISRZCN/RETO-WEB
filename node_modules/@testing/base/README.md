## Base

Module which provides us with some core utilities incoporated into the [Acis](https://globaldevtools.bbva.com/bitbucket/projects/BGT/repos/e2e-js-framework/browse) framework.

Some of these utilities are exposed to be used publicly so, if you're not using Acis as your e2e testing framework but are still interested in providing integration with some of the packages, feel free to check out the specification:

- **[UserProvider](https://globaldevtools.bbva.com/bitbucket/projects/BGT/repos/e2e-js-framework/browse/packages/base/docs/classes/UserProvider.md)** - It exposes an interface to interact with [DataManager](https://globaldevtools.bbva.com/bitbucket/projects/BGT/repos/data-manager/browse).
