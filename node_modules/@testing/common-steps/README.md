## Common Steps

This package contains [Cucumber steps](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/support_files/step_definitions.md) which help us interact with [DataManager](https://globaldevtools.bbva.com/data-manager), in a way that makes it possible to easily retrieve users' data according to specific requirements defined by tags.

All the steps definitions in this package are marked with the label *\[framework\]*, just for identification purposes.

-----------------------

### DataManager Steps

The steps exposed are the ones listed below:  

---

#### I'm a user with tags "" \[framework\]

It retrieves an user with a profile that fullfills with a series of requirements defined by tags.

Example:

```txt
  @example
  Feature: Example
  
  Scenario: Example of scenario using DataManager 
  
      Given I'm a user with tags "example, example2" [framework]
      And I'm in the Example page
      When I click the special button
      Then The example info is updated with nmore info
```

---

#### "" is a user with tags "" \[framework\]

It retrieves an user with a profile that fullfills with a series of requirements defined by tags, giving it an alias so we can use data from more than one user in the same scenario.  

-----------------------

### Additional Info

**Common Steps** is part of the Acis framework, meaning that DataManager steps are ready to be added to a [Cucumber scenario](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#example) in a way you can get a specific user's profile without having to handle any type of logic behind.

Users' profiles can be retrieved and interacted with from your Cucumber steps implementation via [World global object](https://globaldevtools.bbva.com/bitbucket/projects/BGT/repos/e2e-js-framework/browse/packages/cucumber-runner/docs/World.md)

For more info, you can check the [cucumber-runner](https://globaldevtools.bbva.com/bitbucket/projects/BGT/repos/e2e-js-framework/browse/packages/cucumber-runner/README.md) documentation.
